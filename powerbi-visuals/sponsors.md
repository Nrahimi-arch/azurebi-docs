# Custom Visual Sponsors

All my custom visuals are free of charge available and can be used by everyone without any limitations. This means that all the development and support is based on the time I have available besides my day-to-day job.

Unfortunately I cannot find a good model to add paid support for my visuals without cutting functionality, what I do not like.
So I desided to keep the visuals as is (free of charge) and open the option to become a sponsor of my custom visuals. With the support of sponsors it allows me to reserve more time to support the existing ones.
