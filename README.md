# AzureBI documentation

The repository contains the open sourced [documentation](https://azurebi-docs.jppp.org) of my community projects, like my custom visuals.

If you want to contribute to the documentation, see the [contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [issues list](https://github.com/liprec/azurebi-docs/issues) if you would like to help out.
